# Public Domain E-Books

This repository is meant as a place for me to experiment with e-book generation.

## Context

I recently received a Kobo as a gift. I also recently joined a book club.

Our book this month is [A Room of One's Own](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Room_of_One's_Own), which also happens to have [entered the public domain on January 1, 2025](https://web.law.duke.edu/cspd/publicdomainday/2025/).

I tried grabbing an `.epub` from `archive.org`, and also checked Project Gutenberg, but I noticed a few little nit-picky things that didn't feel smooth and polished reading on my Kobo. So I figured it'd be worth doing a little investigation, and experimenting with generating `.epub` files from markdown. If I end up liking the workflow, maybe I can run with it and find public domain works that aren't yet in `.epub`, and see if I can contribute a little bit.

## Updates

### 2025-01-22 - tangent to get a black-and-white reduced size pdf

I downloaded a nice PDF of a 1935 edition of A Room of One's Own, but the file is 70 megabytes so I'm nervous to even try to load it onto my e-reader. I want a way to take a fancy full-colour PDF and covert it to black-and-white. Preferably with the option to tune the threshold, and dither effects would be nice to.

For context, my current understanding is that EPUB is more or less XHTML 1.1, but with some limited features, and very limited support for CSS. It seems like fonts can also be embedded. I find this kind of exciting, because it means I might be able to mess around with styling, and try to create an e-book edition of A Room of One's Own that roughly matches the 1935 edition.

Here are some starting points:

- Using `ghostscript` - <https://superuser.com/questions/200378/converting-a-pdf-to-black-white-with-ghostscript>
- Using `imagemagick` - <https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/93959/how-to-convert-a-color-pdf-to-black-white>
- Using `imagemagick` - <https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/discussions/2110>

### 2025-01-21 - diving in

I'm also sure I can use existing tooling for the `.md` to `.epub` conversion. I want to explore what [CommonMark spec](https://commonmark.org/) markdown syntax and features are fully supported. If it's all of them, that'll be great. I also want to explore how markdown syntax translates into the `.epub` format.

Selfishly, I do think it'd be kind of neat to experiment with a custom tool. Maybe it could be part of the [unified](https://unifiedjs.com/) ecosystem. Maybe there could be some [frontmatter](https://docs.github.com/en/contributing/writing-for-github-docs/using-yaml-frontmatter) in the markdown file, though I'm surprised at how frontmatter isn't as fully spec'd out and formalized as markdown. Yoink, [Pandoc already seems to support YAML frontmatter](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#epubs).

[Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/installing.html) looks like a promising starting point.

### Footnotes

EPUB footnotes are apparently a thing, which is great, cause _A Room of One's Own_ has some inline footnotes.

The TLDR seems to be:

```html
<!--Converting to single lines-->
<!--Inline-->
<p>This is some text that needs a footnote.<a href="FN_Section0001.xhtml#fn1" epub:type="noteref" id="bookfn1">[1]</a></p>

<!-- Footnote content -->
<body>
<aside epub:type="footnote" id="fn1">
  <p>This is the content of the footnote. <a href="9780061807145_Chapter_1_split_000.xhtml#bookfn1">â†©</a></p>
</aside>
</body>
```
